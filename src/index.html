        <h2>How Impressive, <span class="name-span"></span>!</h2>
        <p>I can tell that you have certainly traveled afar but I might go as far to guess that this is your first visit to Erindale. You must be warned, tread lightly, fortunes are easily made in Erindale and more easily lost. Right now you stand before the gates to the small hamlet of Rothenburg. The inhabitants are not used to world travelers such as yourself. Once you pass these gates, be ambitious but be warned!</p>

        <p>Scenario: <span class="name-span"></span> has passed the wooden gates to the humble village. the inhabitants, when they think they are able to steal a glance, seem to be corrupted with suspicion, however they pass <span class="name-span"></span> without a word</p>
